# react-Redux

Redux is a <strong>state management system </strong> for <strong>cross - component or app - wide state<strong>

<strong>Redux is one central place where all the data(state) is stored</strong>

<strong>Components subscribe to those state to get access</strong>

<strong>Components never directly don't change the state.Component uses reducer function 
<strong style = {color : red;}>(Not React useReducer() function)<strong> to manipulate the data 
<strong style = {color : red;}> i.e. there is uni-directional flow of data between central state and components<strong><strong>
